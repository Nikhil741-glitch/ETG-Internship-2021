# ETG-Internship-2021

PROJECT - 1

My first project in this internship is INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
In this project, I made an inventory using JSON in python. The inventory is of a bakery namely "BREAD & BUTTER".
This project consists of two parts, one is update the purchase items portal in which the employee update the items which they purchase in the portal and another is selling portal where the people come to purchase the items.

SELLING PORTAL -->
This portal shows all the items with its attributes to the user. Then the user enter the items which he want to buy through their ID's and then their quantity. Then the billing amount after discount(if applicable) shows to the customer, after which he pays the amount and the bill receipt is generated to the user.
After every purchase, the quantity of items got updated in the inventory and the bill goes into the sales file for record. You can see the inventory in the record.json file and the sales details in the sale detail.json file. 
You can see the code of selling portal with output in Selling Portal.ipynb file. Also I share a text file of the output namely Selling_History_Output.txt.

PURCHASE ITEMS UPDATE PORTAL -->
This portal is used for two purposes by the company employees. One for updating the newly purchased items in the inventory, that is all the new items with all its attributes can be updated to the inventory and another one is for updating the existing items quantity in the inventory, that is if the item is already present in the inventory and we need to update its quantity only.
You can see the code of purchase items update portal with output in Purchase Items Update Portal.ipynb file. Also I share a text file with the output namely Purchase_Update_Quantity_Output.txt.
