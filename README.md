# ETG-Internship-2021

PROJECT - 1

My first project in this internship is Inventory Management System.
In this project, I made an inventory using JSON in python. The inventory is of a bakery where the user came on the bakery's online portal to do shopping.
There are various items in the bakery.
First of all, portal shows all the items with its attributes to the user. Then the user enter the items which he want to buy through their ID's and then their quantity. Then the billing amount after discount(if applicable) shows to the customer, after which he pays the amount and the bill receipt is generated to the user.
After that the quantity of the items in the record file get updated and also the sales file got updated with the bill.  
You can see the code with output in IMS_CODE.ipynb file. Also I share a text file of the output.
Also there are two JSON files (Record and Sales files) updated on this repository.
